# Java Adventure Game

## Introduction

**Multi-User Dungeon ( MUD )**

A [MUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) (originally Multi-User Dungeon, 
with later variants Multi-User Dimension and Multi-User Domain), is a 
multiplayer real-time virtual world, usually 
[text-based](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_game).
MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, 
[interactive fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Fiction),
and online chat. Players can read or view descriptions of rooms, objects,
other players, non-player characters, and actions performed in the virtual world.
Players typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that
resemble a natural language.

Traditional MUDs implement a role-playing video game set in a fantasy world populated by
fictional races and monsters, with players choosing classes in order to gain specific
skills or powers. The objective of this sort of game is to slay monsters, explore a
fantasy world, complete quests, go on adventures, create a story by role playing,
and advance the created character. Many MUDs were fashioned around the dice-rolling
rules of the Dungeons & Dragons series of games.

JAdventure is a very simple Java based implementation of a Multi-User Dungeon.
    
**WARNING**

The current version has only one concrete MUD Adventure game implemented.
